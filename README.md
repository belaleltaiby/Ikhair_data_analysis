# Ikhair_data_analysis

This project involves analyzing data and visualizing insights using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas. An interactive dashboard was created in Looker Studio to showcase the findings.

## Dashboard
I have created an interactive dashboard using Looker Studio to display key insights from the data analysis. You can view the dashboard here:

## Project Overview
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas to clean, transform, and analyze the data.
- **Dashboard**: The dashboard presents visualizations that help in understanding data trends and metrics.

## File Details
- `Task_data_analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook used for data analysis and preparation for visualization.
- `Users.csv`: The users data file
- `Users_Transactions.csv`: The transactions table
  
## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `Task_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter to explore the analysis.
3. Visit the [Looker Studio Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/f8f8185b-9e52-4482-bb64-e07c3b7f3c3c) to interact with the visualizations.

## Tools Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: For data analysis, using the Pandas library for data manipulation and processing.
- **Looker Studio**: For creating the interactive dashboard.
